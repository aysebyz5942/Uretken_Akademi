        <p>The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈|少年|團), 
          literally meaning "Bulletproof Boy Scouts". According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".
          In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity. 
          This extended their name to mean "growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.</p>

        <p class="bilgi">2010–2014: Formation and early years
        BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping.BTS was originally supposed to be a hip hop group similar to YG Entertainment, but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided instead to create an idol group similar to Seo Taiji and Boys who were popular in the 90's. A group able to make socially conscious music without the restrictions K-pop bands were known for, able to be sincere and genuine at a time where K-pop bands were highly regimented. They were later reorganized into a more traditional idol group. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.
        We started to tell the stories that people wanted to hear and were ready to hear, stories that other people could not or would not tell. We said what other people were feeling—like pain, anxieties and worries. That was our goal, to create this empathy that people can relate to.
        On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, the first installment of their "school trilogy" series, simultaneously with its lead single "No More Dream", which quickly fell off the charts. The album, however, reached the top five in South Korea on the Gaon Music Chart. Their subsequent single "We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2" failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s–90s and strong visuals.The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows.Despite being unpolished, critics say these early live performances demonstrated BTS' potential.Expanding their endeavors to Japan, "No More Dream" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014.
        In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their "school trilogy," the extended play O!RUL8,2?, along with its single "N.O,".[25] Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts.That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 2013 Melon Music Awards, 28th Golden Disc Awards, and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards.</p>

On July 19, according to Digital Songs chart, "Permission to Dance" became BTS' eighth number-one, extending the record as the group with the most number one hits on the chart.

On November 23, 2021, BTS' "Butter" earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[257] At the end of November, BTS returned to live performances, following a number of previous cancellations during 2021 due to COVID-19, in Los Angeles with The Independent reporting that, "Over the course of a thrilling two-and-a-half hour show, the band's seven members deliver a sublime succession of pop hits, combining meticulously choreographed dance routines with clearly unrehearsed moments of heartfelt sincerity".
        On January 15, 2022, a new fictional webtoon based on BTS, titled 7Fates: Chako, was released with Variety reporting that it "has surpassed 15 million views in just two days of global launch ...
